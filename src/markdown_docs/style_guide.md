# Writing Guidelines

## Be Concise
- Root descriptions: max 30 words
- Branch descriptions: max 20 words
- Result descriptions: max 100 words
- Exceptions: rare, a few cases per commission

## Show, Don't Tell
- Focus on character's senses and observable elements
- Avoid putting words in player's mouth or thoughts in their head
- Example: Instead of "All across London...", use specific instances

## Exposition
- Use dialogue to convey information
- Direct speech should pass the "say-this-shit" test
- Put NPCs in distress or vulnerability for more characterful dialogue

## Victorian Style
- Use sparingly, as seasoning rather than main ingredient

## Player Appearance
- Avoid gender-specific or appearance-specific descriptions
- Use neutral terms like "sleeves" or "hems"

## Branch Fiction
- Make actions clear in branch titles or descriptions

## Results
- Describe one action (or closely-related ones) and their results
- Break complex sequences into multiple branches

## Language
- Use British English, not American English

## Content Guidelines
- No on-stage harm to children
- Weather: only drizzles, no wind (unless plot-related)
- Time: always dark, use social events to indicate time

## Writing Style
- Be cautious with passive voice
- Use single-sentence paragraphs sparingly
- Avoid clich√©s (e.g., "diaphanous gowns", "black as pitch")

## The Player Viewpoint
The player is the leader of the expeditionary force.  The mercenaries in your party are just some of the group; the rest are various kinds of camp-follower, who are going to be very nervous about what you're trekking through.  Don't introduce new named characters; just refer to them by their role.

## 

## Tense and perspective
Always use present-tense and second-person point of view ("you see a bird out the corner of your vision").


## EXAMPLE PROSE

* You dream that you're flinging books happily on to the Stolen River, the one they used to call the Thames. The river is on fire! Flames leap higher than the houses on either side. Every time you throw another book on, there is a flare of coloured light, like a firework, and a puff of sweet-scented smoke. You look down and realise with horror that you've run out of books: you are flinging your clothes on to the fire. When your clothes are gone, you begin peeling off skin and throwing that. You wake before it goes very much further.

* You can go anywhere. You use secret passages to enter the rooms of your enemies, vulnerable in their sleep. You climb dark staircases and cross vast, silent halls. You can do anything. Anything except scrub this gore from your hands.
