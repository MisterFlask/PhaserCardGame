 * 
 * the landscape is ulcerated with neatly arranged tents, a clinic nestled absurdly into the blistered flank of hell. your caravan halts. clog-footed figures shuffle eagerly forward, pristine lab coats stark against volcanic dust. One of your soldier's mutters "B___dy cloggers" under his breath; then, one notices you.

"ah, goedendag!" their leader greets you cheerfully, adjusting brass-framed spectacles that do nothing against the smoke. "you hef arrifed at a most oppurtune moment, mijn vrienden! ja, history in de making—met uw hulp, natuurlijk."

he gestures expansively. "ve are conductink a small, very controlled ekshperiment. ve vould like vun of your men to hef just a klein infection—nothing to vorry about. a touch of ze ashen flux. highly educational, yes?"

his assistant reveals a velvet-lined box, the interior obscured by the sickly glow of something potent—and likely infernal. "und naturlich, ve vill offer you vun of our... unique ekshperimental artefacts. a very rare specimen, ja? fascinating properties!"

he smiles reassuringly. "ze prognosis is very goed. almost entirely survivable. ve hef many... promising remedies."

the clogger beams expectantly, oblivious to your crew’s discomfort, rocking gently on the absurd wooden shoes that somehow remain spotless amidst Hell’s ashes.
