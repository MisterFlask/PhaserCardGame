# BACKGROUND
 After James Maxwell mathematically derived the theoretical possibility of extraplanar travel in 1855, Queen Victoria authorized usage of the Empire's finest engineers and artistans for engineering the first trans-dimensional gateway to Hell.  After three decades of failed prototypes, the first stable such gateway (the so-called Buckingham Rift) was completed in 1885.

 The year, now, is 1890. The Third Circle Company, a joint venture between the British Trade Delegation and several prominent Brimstone Barons, has established a monopoly on trans-dimensional shipping between London and Dis. Their fleet of iron-clad land-crawlers, specially fitted with Maxwell coils and blessed hull plating, makes regular runs through the Buckingham Rift carrying cargo, colonists, and (if certain rumors are to be believed) more sinister passengers. The Company's meteoric rise has disrupted centuries of established trade relationships within Hell, much to the consternation of the Artisanal Guilds and certain members of the Cinder Court who find themselves increasingly marginalized in this new era of British-Infernal commerce.

# FACTIONS

### The Stoker's Union
These grim-faced laborers toil endlessly to keep the infernal fires of the Furnace of Dis burning. Without their backbreaking work, Hell would freeze over, quite literally. They hold immense power due to their indispensable role but face threats from new technologies like the River Styx turbine. Expect strikes, protests, and perhaps even sabotage as they fight to maintain their monopoly over Hell's energy production.

### The British Trade Delegation
Led by shrewd diplomats and backed by the technological marvels of James Maxwell, the British seek to exploit Hell's resources and cheap labor. The construction of the Buckingham Rift has given them an unprecedented foothold in this alien realm. They navigate the treacherous political landscape with a mix of cunning, bribery, and the occasional threat of angelic intervention.

### The Artisanal Guilds
These ancient orders of hellish craftsmen were responsible for building and stabilizing the infernal side of the trans-dimensional gateway. The influx of British goods and influence threatens their traditional ways, and they resent the disruption to their centuries-old power structures. Expect them to form alliances with disgruntled factions or even engage in occult sabotage to protect their interests.

Characteristic Accent: Received Pronunciation

### The Brimstone Barons
These wealthy industrialists control the production and export of Brimstone Distillate, Hell's most valuable resource. They have grown rich and powerful supplying Earth's growing demand for this infernal fuel. However, the British seek to negotiate directly with them, bypassing traditional intermediaries and upsetting long-standing business arrangements.

### The Infernal Aristocracy (aka the Cinder Court)
Composed of ancient noble houses and powerful demonic lineages, the aristocracy sees itself as the rightful rulers of Hell. They view the British with a mix of disdain and opportunism, seeking to manipulate the newcomers to their own ends. Some may even dream of using British weapons and technology in their eternal war against Heaven.

### The Cult of the Invasion
This fanatical group is dedicated to preparing for the final invasion of Heaven. They see the British as potential allies in their apocalyptic cause, hoping to acquire powerful new weapons and technologies. However, their fervor and single-minded focus on the impossible invasion make them unpredictable and dangerous partners.

# LOCATIONS

### The City of Dis
A sprawling metropolis of twisted, gothic architecture and infernal industry. The city is home to the Furnace of Dis, which powers the factories and workshops that produce the majority of Hell's exports. The streets are filled with the constant clamor of machinery and the cries of the damned souls who toil endlessly in the city's sweatshops and foundries. Dis is also the center of infernal politics, with various demonic factions vying for control over the city's resources and power.

### The Styx Delta
A vast, swampy region where the River Styx splits into countless tributaries and channels before emptying into the infernal sea. The delta is a labyrinth of mangrove forests, bubbling tar pits, and floating islands of bone and rotting flesh. Strange, bioluminescent creatures swim in the dark waters, and eerie, whispering voices echo through the mist-shrouded air. The delta is home to several competing soul-trading outposts, each one vying for control over the lucrative trade in damned essences.

### The Brimstone Badlands
A desolate, volcanic region where the majority of Hell's brimstone is mined. The landscape is dotted with jagged, obsidian peaks, bubbling lava flows, and vast, open-pit mines where legions of damned souls toil to extract the precious resource. The air is thick with choking, sulfurous fumes, and the ground trembles with the constant rumble of infernal machinery. The Brimstone Barons maintain heavily fortified compounds in the badlands, protecting their mines and refineries from rival factions and rebellious workers.

### The Screaming Forests
A vast, primeval wilderness of twisted, sentient trees that wail and moan in agony. The forest floor is carpeted in a thick layer of pulsating, fleshy moss, and strange, bioluminescent fungi grow in the shadows. The trees are said to be the remains of damned souls who were transformed into living wood as punishment for their sins. The forest is home to a variety of bizarre and dangerous creatures, including giant, carnivorous slugs and swarms of razor-winged butterflies.

### The Clockwork Wastes
A barren, windswept region where the ruins of ancient, infernal machines litter the landscape. The wastes are home to a variety of scavenger tribes and nomadic bands who pick through the ruins in search of valuable components and arcane technologies. Strange, half-mechanical creatures roam the wastes, the products of long-forgotten experiments in infernal cybernetics. The British have taken a particular interest in the Clockwork Wastes, hoping to uncover lost technologies that could give them an edge in their trade negotiations.

### The Abyssal Frontier
A vast, unexplored region on the edge of Hell, where the infernal realms give way to the infinite darkness of the abyss. The frontier is a place of unsettling silence and strange, alien geometries, where the laws of physics and reason break down. Brave (or foolish) explorers venture into the abyss in search of forbidden knowledge and cosmic secrets, but few return unchanged, if they return at all.

# STYLE GUIDE
In terms of flavor, please take heavy inspiration from Fallen London's brand of very dry, very british humor combined with lovecraftian horror.
