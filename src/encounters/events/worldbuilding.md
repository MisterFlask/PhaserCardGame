# BACKGROUND
 After James Maxwell mathematically derived the theoretical possibility of extraplanar travel in 1855, Queen Victoria authorized usage of the Empire's finest engineers and artistans for engineering the first trans-dimensional gateway to Hell.  After three decades of failed prototypes, the first stable such gateway (the so-called Buckingham Rift) was completed in 1885.

 The year, now, is 1890. The Third Circle Company, a joint venture between the British Trade Delegation and several prominent Brimstone Barons, has established a monopoly on trans-dimensional shipping between London and Dis. Their fleet of iron-clad land-crawlers, specially fitted with Maxwell coils and blessed hull plating, makes regular runs through the Buckingham Rift carrying cargo, colonists, and (if certain rumors are to be believed) more sinister passengers. The Company's meteoric rise has disrupted centuries of established trade relationships within Hell, much to the consternation of the Artisanal Guilds and certain members of the Cinder Court who find themselves increasingly marginalized in this new era of British-Infernal commerce.

 (Technically it is not really clear that Hell has any specific relationship to the Christian realm of punishment for sinners, but the aesthetic parallels were strong enough to overcome any academic screeching on this topic, and people simply started referring to it as Hell regardless.  Some academics still futilely insist that everyone call it "The Maxwell-Babbage Adiabatic Plane", which they certainly will not.)

# FACTIONS

### The Stoker's Union
Born from a peculiar twist of fate when a crate of smuggled Marxist literature found its way through the Buckingham Rift, these grim-faced laborers discovered a new way to articulate their ancient grievances. The pamphlets spread like wildfire through Hell's working class, with the stokers of the great Furnace of Dis being particularly receptive to concepts of worker solidarity and means of production. Without their backbreaking work, Hell would freeze over, quite literally - a fact that gave them considerable leverage in organizing. They hold immense power but face threats from new technocapital developments, like the River Styx turbine.

In terms of style and accent, the Stoker's Union members are loyal to the Cause but not particularly bright, and speak with a strong cockney accent liberally peppered with misunderstood Marxist terminology.

### The British Trade Delegation
Led by shrewd diplomats and backed by the technological marvels of James Maxwell, the British seek to exploit Hell's resources and cheap labor. The construction of the Buckingham Rift has given them an unprecedented foothold in this alien realm. They navigate the treacherous political landscape with a mix of cunning, bribery, and the occasional threat of angelic intervention.

### The Artisanal Guilds
These ancient orders of hellish craftsmen were responsible for building and stabilizing the infernal side of the trans-dimensional gateway. The influx of British goods and influence threatens their traditional ways, and they resent the disruption to their centuries-old power structures. Expect them to form alliances with disgruntled factions or even engage in occult sabotage to protect their interests.

In terms of style and accent, the Artisanal Guilds are merchants in an economically-desperate struggle for survival.  They see the past as idyllic and the future as a dark and dangerous place.  Yorkshire accent.

### The Brimstone Barons
These wealthy industrialists control the production and export of Brimstone Distillate, Hell's most valuable resource. They have grown rich and powerful supplying Earth's growing demand for this infernal fuel. However, the British seek to negotiate directly with them, bypassing traditional intermediaries and upsetting long-standing business arrangements.

In terms of style and accent, the Barons view themselves as hard-nosed industrialists and sneer at the refined frippery of the Cinder Court.

### The Infernal Aristocracy (aka the Cinder Court)
Composed of ancient noble houses and powerful demonic lineages, the aristocracy sees itself as the rightful rulers of Hell. They view the British with a mix of disdain and opportunism, seeking to manipulate the newcomers to their own ends. Some may even dream of using British weapons and technology in their eternal war against Heaven.

In terms of style and accent, the Court believes itself to be better and more refined than the common Devils, taking extreme inspiration from the highest of high british culture.  They wear porcelain masks, and each Devil has a collection of them which are swapped out to match specific emotional states or occasions.

### The Cult of the Invasion
This fanatical group is dedicated to preparing for the final invasion of Heaven. They see the British as potential allies in their apocalyptic cause, hoping to acquire powerful new weapons and technologies. However, their fervor and single-minded focus on the impossible invasion make them unpredictable and dangerous partners.

In terms of style and accent, the Cult is a group of intellectuals convinced they alone understand the truth of Hell and reality.


### The Underclass
The lowest rung of Hell's social ladder, these wretched souls are the descendants of damned humans who have lived in Hell for generations. They work the most dangerous and degrading jobs, from cleaning the toxic sludge pits to testing experimental British machinery. Many live in sprawling shanty towns built from scavenged industrial waste and broken dreams.

In terms of style and accent, the Underclass speaks with a mix of cockney and various regional British accents, heavily corrupted by infernal slang. Their dialogue should reflect desperation and dark humor about their circumstances.


# LOCATIONS

### The City of Dis
A sprawling metropolis of twisted, gothic architecture and infernal industry. The city is home to the Furnace of Dis, which powers the factories and workshops that produce the majority of Hell's exports. The streets are filled with the constant clamor of machinery and the cries of the damned souls who toil endlessly in the city's sweatshops and foundries. Dis is also the center of infernal politics, with various demonic factions vying for control over the city's resources and power.

### the Furnace of Dis
The heart of Dis's industrial might, this colossal furnace complex stretches for miles in every direction. Ancient beyond reckoning, its flames have burned since before the first human soul arrived in Hell. The main chamber is a cathedral of industry, where massive iron grates channel the heat generated through burning the River Phlegethon to power the city's factories and forges. The Stoker's Union maintains strict control over access, treating the facility with an almost religious reverence.

While it clearly provides power for Hell's industry, some whisper that it serves a more vital function - perhaps preventing the entire realm from freezing solid, or maintaining some crucial metaphysical balance. The British Trade Delegation has made several attempts to study its inner workings, but the Stokers have thus far successfully resisted all such "modernizing influences."

### The Styx Delta
A vast, swampy region where the River Styx splits into countless tributaries and channels before emptying into the infernal sea. The delta is a labyrinth of mangrove forests, bubbling tar pits, and floating islands of bone and rotting flesh. Strange, bioluminescent creatures swim in the dark waters, and eerie, whispering voices echo through the mist-shrouded air. The delta is home to several competing soul-trading outposts, each one vying for control over the lucrative trade in damned essences.

### The Brimstone Badlands
A desolate, volcanic region where the majority of Hell's brimstone is mined. The landscape is dotted with jagged, obsidian peaks, bubbling lava flows, and vast, open-pit mines where legions of damned souls toil to extract the precious resource. The air is thick with choking, sulfurous fumes, and the ground trembles with the constant rumble of infernal machinery. The Brimstone Barons maintain heavily fortified compounds in the badlands, protecting their mines and refineries from rival factions and rebellious workers.

### The Screaming Forests
A vast, primeval wilderness of twisted, sentient trees that wail and moan in agony. The forest floor is carpeted in a thick layer of pulsating, fleshy moss, and strange, bioluminescent fungi grow in the shadows. The forest is home to a variety of bizarre and dangerous creatures, including giant, carnivorous slugs and swarms of razor-winged butterflies.

### The Clockwork Wastes
A barren, windswept region where the ruins of ancient, infernal machines litter the landscape. The wastes are home to a variety of scavenger tribes and nomadic bands who pick through the ruins in search of valuable components and arcane technologies. Strange, half-mechanical creatures roam the wastes, the products of long-forgotten experiments in infernal cybernetics. The British have taken a particular interest in the Clockwork Wastes, hoping to uncover lost technologies that could give them an edge in their negotiations with the Barons.

### The Abyssal Frontier
A vast, unexplored region on the edge of Hell, where the infernal realms give way to the infinite darkness of the abyss. The frontier is a place of unsettling silence and strange, alien geometries, where the laws of physics and reason break down. Brave (or foolish) explorers venture into the abyss in search of forbidden knowledge and cosmic secrets, but few return unchanged, if they return at all.

# STYLE GUIDE
In terms of flavor, please aim for lots of very dry corporate humor combined with lovecraftian horror. 

## SETTING DETAILS

THE THIRD CIRCLE COMPANY’S UNAUTHORIZED ALLOCATION OF “GATEWAY ACCESS PERMITS”
In a recently recorded incident known internally as THE BRASS KEY INQUIRY, lower-level agents within THE BRITISH TRADE DELEGATION’s own accounting department (the so-called “Counters of Infernal Ledgers”) have discovered the quiet issuance of specialized, gilt-edged travel documents to a series of individuals operating under CINDER COURT patronage. These documents, intended to grant expedited passage through the BUCKINGHAM RIFT, seem to have bypassed the ARTISANAL GUILDS’ traditional vetting procedures for trans-dimensional cargo manifests. This small-scale administrative irregularity—apparently the result of senior managers at THE THIRD CIRCLE COMPANY negotiating side agreements in dimly-lit vaults beneath THE FURNACE OF DIS—has potentially undermined the painstakingly cultivated balance between old infernal craftsmanship traditions and new British mercantile influences. The GUILDS have begun covertly marking each questionable permit with an intricate wax seal rumored to contain micro-hexes designed to cause subtle mechanical failures in the Company’s next generation of land-crawlers.

THE STOKER’S UNION INTERNAL DISSENSION OVER THE RIVER STYX TURBINE
Within the STOKER’S UNION itself, the recent, ill-omened unveiling of the RIVER STYX TURBINE—a device allegedly procured from THE CLOCKWORK WASTES and quietly tested by a subdivision of THE BRITISH TRADE DELEGATION—has sown discord. A faction of younger STOKERS (calling themselves “THE SHADOWED HEAT COLLECTIVE”) has advocated replacing traditional coal-lashers with these whispering turbines, which they claim to have witnessed during a forbidden midnight meeting with unnamed British engineers. Meanwhile, the UNION’s conservative leadership, supposedly advised by an unnamed member of the CINDER COURT with historical ties to the oldest infernal furnaces, insists that adopting such technology would be tantamount to surrendering their sacred duty. Tension within the UNION has grown so severe that union members from rival forges have begun sabotaging one another’s fire grates, culminating in the so-called “SEARED PLENUM INCIDENT,” a still-confidential matter in which several foremen were found trapped inside heat-lock chambers, ranting incoherently about metallic angels.

THE BRIMSTONE BARONS’ DISTRUST OF NEW BRITISH PROCUREMENT STANDARDS
In the BRIMSTONE BADLANDS, where the BARONS rule over extraction and refinement, a subtle but increasing animosity has emerged between the BARONS’ established syndicates and a small cadre of British-appointed “Resource Inspection Liaison Officers.” Said officers, introduced after the outcome of the unfortunate “MCALLISTER SURVEY,” have begun applying Earth-based safety and quality metrics to brimstone production. The BARONS view these new regulations as laughably terrestrial and an attempt to curb their age-old monopolies. A particular point of conflict has been over “WHITE-FLAME DISTILLATE,” a newly discovered variant of brimstone rumored to burn with an ineffable shriek. Although exact details remain classified, certain BARONS claim that the British have secret designs on this rare product for unspecified “Heaven-Ward Operations.” In response, the BARONS have stationed private militias at critical extraction sites and initiated a silent embargo on exports deemed “substandard” by British inspectors—thus ensuring that nothing meeting British criteria can leave the mines without first passing through the BARONS’ own alchemical labs, where certain “improvements” are introduced.

THE ARTISANAL GUILDS’ INCREASING COLLABORATION WITH UNDERCLASS SABOTEURS
As the GUILDS struggle to maintain their influence over the shaping of trans-dimensional gateways, they have begun to discreetly arm certain bands of the UNDERCLASS with specialized tools: sharpened alloy files, resonance wrenches infused with infernal carapace shards, and encrypted instructions for destabilizing Maxwell coils. These clandestine instructions, linked by rumor to the elusive “FOURTH KEYMASTER OF THE OLD IRON PORTAL,” detail subtle ways to induce harmonic imbalances in the land-crawlers used by THE THIRD CIRCLE COMPANY. The UNDERCLASS participants, desperate for any opportunity to strike against exploitive labor conditions, have already initiated several small-scale sabotage operations near THE STYX DELTA outposts. This secret alliance has placed the GUILDS at odds with THE CULT OF THE INVASION, who had also been courting UNDERCLASS allies to construct a grand weapon rumored to be hidden deep in THE SCREAMING FORESTS. Now the CULT looks upon the GUILDS with suspicion, believing them to be part of an elaborate British subterfuge aimed at diverting attention from whatever it is that truly lies beyond THE ABYSSAL FRONTIER.

THE CULT OF THE INVASION’S SCHISM OVER ALLIANCE STRATEGIES
Within THE CULT OF THE INVASION itself, intellectual factions have reached a breaking point. One clique, known as THE ASCENDANT MATHEMATICIANS, insists that the path to Heaven’s downfall lies in careful study of recently smuggled Maxwellian treatises, supposedly on loan from THE BRITISH TRADE DELEGATION’s restricted libraries. Another group, calling itself THE ORACULAR QUILL DIVISION, claims that only by securing occult artifacts from THE CLOCKWORK WASTES—specifically certain “Ebon-Forged Components” salvaged from prelapsarian infernal war machines—can the CULT hope to breach Heaven’s gates. Internal debates over resource allocation have devolved into subtle poisonings, cryptic memos delivered by eyeless couriers, and sabotage of lecture halls. The recent disappearance of “PROFESSOR ELDERFIELD” (a key figure in the Quill Division), last seen attempting to translate forbidden runic inscriptions near THE SCREAMING FORESTS, has only fueled suspicions that the Mathematicians have begun to cull rival thinkers. Rumors that THE BRITISH TRADE DELEGATION is intentionally feeding each faction contradictory documents as a form of intellectual espionage persist, but remain unproven.

THE CINDER COURT’S DISCREET SUPPORT OF INSURRECTION IN THE STOKER RANKS
The CINDER COURT, vexed by the growing importance of British engineering standards and envious of THE BRIMSTONE BARONS’ fortunes, has whispered counsel into the ears of certain influential Stokers. After the ignoble conclusion of “THE IRON COVENANT RITUAL,” which allegedly failed due to British interference in the fuel supply lines, the COURT has begun furnishing disgruntled STOKERS with rare grimoires that purport to show how to harness furnace heat into metaphysical “Freezing Bombs”—devices capable of halting production cycles in crucial British-occupied mills. Although the STOKER’S UNION leadership has thus far remained loyal to their ancient rites, it is clear that these aristocratic overtures have emboldened minor foremen. Quiet attempts have been made to sabotage British attempts at analyzing the innermost workings of THE FURNACE OF DIS. Should the British respond by introducing angelic runic inhibitors, as they have hinted in coded memoranda, the COURT may escalate by revealing additional “lost engineering formulas” that promise to re-route planar fire streams through unauthorized dimensional fissures. The resulting conflict would be, according to one particularly dry business quarterly published in Dis, “marginally suboptimal.”

MCALLISTER SURVEY
The MCALLISTER SURVEY refers to a short-lived, British-administered attempt to impose terrestrial resource classification standards on Brimstone extraction facilities located deep in the BRIMSTONE BADLANDS. Conducted under the auspices of the British Trade Delegation’s so-called “Infernal Materials Division,” this effort involved a cadre of Earth-trained surveyors arriving in Hell armed with ledgers, density gauges, and a series of alarmingly comprehensive questionnaires. The SURVEY’s aim was to determine, in meticulous detail, the proportion of acceptable-to-inferior brimstone yields and to apply some semblance of “rational quota management” to what had previously been a tradition-bound and somewhat cryptically administered industry.
The BRIMSTONE BARONS received these outsiders—reputedly dressed in well-pressed linen suits entirely unsuited to the local climate—with an outward show of politeness, even as their private militias cast suspicious glances. In the end, the SURVEY results were either never finalized or “misplaced.” Some documents survived in partial form, hinting at disputes over the classification of “white-flame distillate” and peculiar references to “incorporeal slag heaps.” The BARONS, having ostensibly cooperated, soon after instituted a series of new internal policies that rendered any foreign classification efforts nugatory. Today, the MCALLISTER SURVEY is remembered chiefly as a footnote in the annals of Hellish trade, a cautionary tale about attempting to impose Earthly rationalizations on a supply chain that is anything but rational.

SEARED PLENUM INCIDENT
The SEARED PLENUM INCIDENT is an oft-whispered event that reportedly unfolded in a locked chamber deep beneath one of the lesser-known expansions of the FURNACE OF DIS. According to heavily redacted union minutes and a handful of overheard disputes in the corridors of a Stoker’s dormitory, a number of mid-ranking foremen were found trapped together, surrounded by anomalously high temperatures that had somehow “folded inward” on their chamber. When they were finally released—through a costly and desperate ventilation effort—the affected Stokers emerged raving about mechanical voices that sang arias in angelic registers, claiming that they had seen iron-hinged gateways open and close without visible operators.
No definitive cause was ever established, and each faction quietly blamed another: the STOKER’S UNION suggested foreign sabotage, the BRITISH TRADE DELEGATION hinted at improper maintenance, and the CINDER COURT darkly referenced “unfathomable precedents.” Despite the confusion, the INCIDENT ensured that subsequent attempts at “modernizing” the Furnace—particularly with untested turbines—were met with trepidation and layers of newly improvised, if not entirely scientifically sound, safety protocols.

“FIRE GATES”
The term “fire gates” is used informally, though persistently, to describe certain regulated access points or mechanical apertures that control the flow of infernal flame. While encountered frequently in engineering blueprints and coded agreements, the exact nature and appearance of these so-called gates remain less than transparent. Some claim they are simple iron grates manned by Stokers to modulate combustion in the Furnace of Dis’s subordinate chambers. Others insist these are far more esoteric contraptions, possibly hybridized Maxwellian constructs that channel metaphysical energy streams from the River Phlegethon.
In any case, these “fire gates” serve as choke-points, allowing privileged operators—most often members of the STOKER’S UNION or select technicians employed by the BRITISH TRADE DELEGATION—to partition and redirect the lifeblood of Hell’s industry. Historical records make veiled references to “gates of unprecedented magnitude” located in the deeper recesses of the Furnace complex, suggesting that control over these vital junctures offers leverage beyond mere industrial efficiency. Though precise schematics remain elusive, “fire gates” are commonly invoked by multiple factions as strategic assets to be secured, sabotaged, or secretly augmented.

THE IRON COVENANT RITUAL
THE IRON COVENANT RITUAL is a historically obscure, yet symbolically charged ceremony reportedly undertaken by members of the CINDER COURT during a period of inter-factional tension. While details are scant—fewer than a dozen authenticated references exist, many couched in guarded legalisms—it appears that this RITUAL involved the careful alignment of ancient infernal runes with imported Earth-based industrial tools, culminating in an attempt to graft mechanical precision onto the raw metaphysical fury of Hell’s inner workings.
Participants are said to have conducted the RITUAL in a sealed chamber not unlike those overseen by the STOKER’S UNION, employing instruments resembling bespoke rivet presses and Maxwell coils while chanting obscure pacts that hinted at cooperation with outside entities (some have speculated at a distant British influence, others suggest interference from unknown planar intermediaries). The endeavor, according to subsequent offhand remarks in aristocratic diaries, failed spectacularly. Machinery was twisted into impossible angles, resonant frequencies rose to ear-splitting crescendos, and the participants—those who survived—were placed under immediate silent scrutiny by the CINDER COURT’s intelligence arms. Ever since, THE IRON COVENANT RITUAL has served as a cautionary allegory: the notion that bridging the gap between arcane tradition and modern engineering is not merely a matter of careful negotiation, but one that may risk fracturing the metaphysical bedrock upon which Hell’s entire economy (and perhaps existence) is precariously built.
