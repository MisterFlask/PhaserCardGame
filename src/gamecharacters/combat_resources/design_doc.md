# COMBAT RESOURCES

Combat resources ought to have both PASSIVE effects-- effects that trigger regardless of whether you've built around them-- and act as FUEL for other effects.
This enables us to have cards that work both as buildarounds and also at baseline, which is fun.

They start at zero in the combat, but are increased with card usage.  Goes down by 1 each turn.

LIGHT
10% chance to block additional stress (caps at 75%)

FIRE
5% chance to empower a random attack card in hand at beginning of turn.  (Empowerment doubles its damage for that turn until played.)

IRON
5% chance to empower a random defense card in hand at beginning of turn.  (Empowerment doubles its defense for that turn until played.)

MIND
For each mind card that exists in your hand, 10% chance to get additional card reward option.

ICE
For each Ice card in your deck at the end of the run, gain additional shareholder satisfaction.

GOLD
For each Gold card in your deck at the end of the run, you get additional wealth.

MUSCLE
For each 3 you get, the whole party gains 1 Strength.


# Auto Balancing Mechanism
Chance to get a particular card decreased for every time you've gotten that card in the run.  (Subtle effect.)
