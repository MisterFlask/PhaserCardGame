## Hurtful Words and Gestures as a general ability?
 * Hammer
Hurtful Words and Gestures:  An unowned ability.  You play it on an ally for all enemies to then target that ally.
You can pay 1 at any time to enable Hurtful Words and Gestures at a cost of 1 energy.

The idea here is that this allows individual-block cards to always get a use.
(Ehhhhh)

## Take Cover as a general ability?
Core idea is that instead of gaining block as a rider, you gain Take Cover! instead.
* Archon
## Lower enemy attack as a rider instead of self-defense?
-- Diabolist, Blackhand

## Just applying block to everyone
-- Sounds stronger than it is, but could be thematically reasonable.
-- Any kind of group AoE attacks would make this necessary.

**Limited** trait on cards:
Increase cost by 1 each time used before resting.
