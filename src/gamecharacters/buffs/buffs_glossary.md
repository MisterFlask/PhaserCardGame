# RESOURCES NOTES
Resources are present in each combat.  In general, resources can be either gained or used as a scaler by a card but never both. (Damage, block, and magic numbers are the types of resource scaling.)  "Relevant classes" refers to classes that can gain the resource from cards, but any class can use any resource as a scaler (though most scalers should actually be related to the class.)

RELEVANT CLASS: Blackhand, Archon

## iron
