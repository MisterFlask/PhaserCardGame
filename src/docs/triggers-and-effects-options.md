Many enemies have mechanics that take the form of a buff that incorporates a when-then trigger: whenever A THING happens, then some other thing happens that either benefits or disadvantages the player.

# when-triggers

when the draw pile reshuffles

when you end the turn with an empty hand

when your hp dips below 25%

when you take unblocked damage

when you fully block an incoming hit

when you kill a non-minion enemy

when any enemy dies

when you apply a debuff

when an enemy intends to attack (>0 dmg icon)

when an enemy intends to buff/defend

when you play your third card this turn

when you play a skill / attack / power (pick one)

when you gain energy outside the normal turn refresh

when a status effect on you expires

when you upgrade a card mid-combat

when this card is copied

when the combat starts

when the combat ends (good for cleanup curses)

# then - effects

deal n damage to a random enemy

deal n damage to all enemies (aural tinnitus optional)

self-inflict n damage (masochism pays dividends)

gain n block

convert current block into damage against a random foe

gain n temporary hp

gain n energy

draw k cards

exhaust k cards from your hand (choice or random)

discard your hand, then draw that many

apply weak / vulnerable / frail / poison / burn / doomed ×n to target

apply strength / dexterity / artifact / plated armor ×n to self

heal n hp

lose n max hp (knowledge always extracts a toll)

add a temporary card (specify) to hand / draw pile / discard pile

duplicate the next card you play this turn

reduce the cost of a random card in hand to 0 this turn

upgrade a random card in hand (yes, mid-fight transmogrification)

remove all debuffs from self (catharsis, free of charge)

remove all buffs from target enemy (schadenfreude sold separately)

stun an enemy for 1 turn (skip its next action)

revive at 1 hp if you would die this combat (one-time, obviously)

trigger all “end of turn” effects immediately (chronomancy is cheating)

add a copy of this card to your discard pile (self-replicating memes)
