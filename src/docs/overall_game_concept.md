## Game Concept Summary

### **Flavor Overview**

A roguelike deckbuilder set in an alternate-history 1880, where Hell has become a contested colonial frontier fought over by European imperialists, demon bureaucrats, and revolutionary movements. Picture a grimly humorous infernal landscapeâ€”part Victorian industrial nightmare, part colonial battleground, and part Kafkaesque bureaucracy.

The player controls the **East Infernal Company**, a mercantile expedition descending into Hell. You'll encounter corrupted wildlife in polluted swamps, Napoleonic undead entrenched in fiery trenches, anarcho-syndicalist demon revolutionaries, and imperialist factions including Germans field-testing artillery, British building telegraph lines, and Americans laying infernal railways.

### **Gameplay and Mechanics**

* **Deckbuilding Roguelike Overlaid With An Overarching Campaign**

  * The campaign is composed of 10 different *caravan runs* into Hell.
  * Each caravan run is, basically, its own roguelike run, where the character takes a selection of three characters from their roster.  The player's goal is to survive the run while making as much profit as possible in the meantime.
  * BETWEEN runs the player can invest their profits in "Strategic Projects."  Strategic Projects embed Victory Points (tallied up at the end of the campaign) and also contain passive effects that trigger on every caravan run into hell from that point onward.
  * Players start with a deck of cards based on the characters they chose for the run; think Slay the Spire.  They add a card (selected from a pool of three) after each combat to their deck from the list of cards eligible for each of the characters in their party.
  * Similar to slay the spire, there is a relic system by which the player can gain passive effects over the course of a run.
  * Each run starts fresh; new cards and relics do not generally persist from run to run.
  * Revenue is made in two main ways:
    (1) The player can bring mundane goods, like coffee, from the surface down into Hell.  They have opportunities to sell these goods after each boss; the further you go into hell the more the mundane goods are worth.  The tradeoff here is that each cargo takes up a slot in your combat deck and most of them are a bit worse than your average basic card.  Take too many and you won't be able to finish the run.
    (2) The player can also acquire Infernal goods (either cards or relics) which can be sold for money at the end of the run but which are extremely disadvantageous to the player in the meantime.  This forms a bit of a push-your-luck mechanic-- the player wants to take as much cargo in and bring as many infernal goods out as possible WITHOUT dying.
  * Card play is tactical: managing cards, energy, combat resources (new mechanic!), and exploiting status effects.
  * Combat resources are an overlay meant to enable easy cross-class synergies; each one (blood, venture, mettle, pluck, smog) cards can either add combat resources or scale off them.
  * It's party-based; the way the party system works is taht the classes of character you take into your party create the card pool you have access to as you continue the run.  The draw pile in combat is simply the cards each character has, which are then mashed together into a deck.  Energy is shared between characters for each turn; you get three energy per turn.

* **Acts & Progression**

  1. **Styx Delta**: Swampy, polluted wetlands with environmentalist demons fighting industrial encroachment.
  2. **Deep France**: Fiery Napoleonic warzone with trench warfare, machine guns, and revisionist-undead armies led by Emperor Napoleon Undying.
  3. **The Dis Foundry Belt** : A sprawling bureaucratic capital that literally runs on infernal paperwork, seals, and red tape, where resource management revolves around using and generating paperwork consumables.

* **Consumable System** (Bureaucracy as Potions)

  * Paperwork, permits, contracts, and decrees act as consumables providing temporary bonuses, debuffs, or battlefield effects.

* **Faction Dynamics**

  * Multiple competing factions: imperialists, revolutionaries, various European continental powers, demonic capitalists, and demonic marxists.  Every once in a while, an angel.
  * The player does NOT take a starring role in these conflicts; they are simply the background which informs random events and enemies the player encounters for each run.

### **Visual & Narrative Style**

* Visual aesthetic mixes Victorian military regalia, Napoleonic uniforms, industrial machinery, and demonic surrealism. Each faction has unique, instantly recognizable color schemes and silhouettes.
* Darkly humorous, satirical tone reminiscent of *Fallen London*, punctuated by bureaucratic absurdity, industrial horrors, and historical parody.

### **Conclusion**

The goal is to deliver a sharply thematic deckbuilder that engages players with both strategic depth and narrative absurdity in a uniquely twisted alternate-history Hellscape.
