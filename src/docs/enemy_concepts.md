LIBRARY OF RUINA ENEMIES CONCEPTS
* enemy that hits with an increase to base damage based on your last attack
* enemy that every 4 hits will switch to a powerful counterhit
* enemy that does a powerful attack if it WASN'T hit this last turn
* enemy that increases in strength each time you hit a specific other enemy
* enemy that decreases in strength each time you play an attack
* enemy that revives immediately if a specific other enemy is living
* enemy that gives you another card each turn in exchange for some other downside
* enemy that decreases the cards drawn per turn


* Ally/enemy combats?!
* ally that is basically a machine gun (benefits dramatically from strength buffs)
* ally that grants you a thing at end of combat... if it survives

* card that specifically hits the left or rightmost living enemy.
* enemy that hits topmost or bottommost character?  (This would require letting player reorder their characters)
* enemy that is immune to all debuffs (or perhaps every other debuff?  Or first debuff each turn?)
* enemy that doesn't let player buff self? (Curse!)
* Enemy that's basically just an explosive barrel that damages everyone once destroyed.
* Enemy that drains x hp from all characters each turn; each card played gives +1 temp HP.
* Enemy type that has powerful intents, but who is stunned any time a minion is killed.  (Or just switches to resurrecting the minion)
* enemy which, each time attacked for less/greater than X damage, switches to a powerful intent.
* enemy that challenges you to kill as many minions as possible.  (Each minion killed causes boss to take x damage?)  (Maybe they all share health bars, effectively?)
* Encounter that involves a character carrying a McGuffin, which dramatically amps up damage taken.  Each character gets an Activatable Buff which moves it to another character.
* Activatable Buff that lets a character take damage in exchange for damage on the enemy.
*  Chopping Block: loads a card on it and, if the card remains, it is destroyed permanently (removed from master deck).
* Troll: fake cards, pushed into your deck.
*  Enemy puts a card continually into your hand, which if not played grants everyone a randomized but known status effect.
