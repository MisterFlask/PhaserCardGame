# BACKGROUND
 After James Maxwell mathematically derived the theoretical possibility of extraplanar travel in 1855, Queen Victoria authorized usage of the Empire's finest engineers and artistans for engineering the first trans-dimensional gateway to Hell.  After three decades of failed prototypes, the first stable such gateway (the so-called Buckingham Rift, a castle-sized precisely machined steel ring through which humans and equipment could pass *without* being ripped apart by trans-dimensional pressure gradients) was completed by a collaboration between Henry Bessemer, Joseph Whitworth, and Eliphas Levi in 1885.  Preliminary expeditions and diplomatic envoys had promising results.

 It is now five years later, in 1890. The Third Circle Company, a joint venture between the British Trade Delegation and several prominent Brimstone Barons, has established a state-sponsored monopoly on trans-dimensional shipping between London and Dis. Their fleet of iron-clad ontological bores, specially fitted with Maxwell coils and blessed hull plating, makes regular runs through the Buckingham Rift carrying cargo, colonists, and even important political dignitaries.

 (Technically it is not really clear that Hell has any specific relationship to the Christian realm of punishment for sinners, but the aesthetic parallels were strong enough to overcome any academic screeching on this topic, and people simply started referring to it as Hell regardless.  Some academics still futilely insist that everyone call it "The Maxwell-Levi Adiabatic Plane", which they certainly will not.)

 # The British Ontological Bores
The British Ontological Bores are massive iron-clad vehicles, resembling a cross between a Victorian battleship and a steam locomotive mounted on enormous caterpillar tracks. Their hulls are covered in blessed steel plating and intricate Maxwell coils that generate protective fields against Hell's more metaphysical hazards. The largest models can be up to 300 feet long, with multiple decks and compartments.

## External Features
The exterior is bristling with defensive features:
- Blessed water cannons to repel lesser demons
- Retractable bridges and loading ramps
- Observation cupolas with reinforced glass
- Emergency exits sealed with holy symbols
- Massive headlamps that pierce the infernal gloom
- Deployable grounding rods to safely discharge hellfire strikes

## Internal Layout
The interior is arranged in a strict hierarchy:
- Bridge Deck: Command center and navigation
- Passenger Decks: Segregated by class, from luxurious first-class cabins to crowded steerage
- Cargo Holds: Reinforced compartments for various goods
- Engineering Decks: Housing the massive steam engines and Maxwell generators
- Crew Quarters: Spartan but secure accommodations
- Chapel: Required by company policy for crew morale

## Crew Composition
A typical crew includes:
- Captain and Officers (usually ex-Royal Navy)
- Engineers (specially trained in Maxwell field maintenance)
- Chaplain (for blessing equipment and crew counseling)
- Security Detail (armed with blessed weapons)
- Medical Staff (trained in both mundane and supernatural ailments)
- Stokers and General Crew (often recruited from Hell's underclass)

## Navigation and Safety
Land Crawlers navigate using a combination of:
- Blessed compasses that point toward the nearest planar gate
- Barometric instruments that detect dimensional instabilities
- Maxwell field sensors to avoid dangerous anomalies
- Traditional maps supplemented with demonic intelligence

Safety protocols are rigorous:
- Regular blessing of critical systems
- Constant monitoring of hull integrity
- Strict quarantine procedures for contaminated cargo
- Emergency protocols for various supernatural threats
- Regular drills for demon attacks and dimensional anomalies

## Life Aboard
Life aboard an Ontological Bore is a unique blend of Victorian maritime tradition and infernal adaptation. The constant rumble of engines mixes with the distant screams of the damned. Crew members wear protective amulets and carry personal blessing kits. The air is filtered through sanctified scrubbers but still carries a hint of brimstone.

The rhythm of shipboard life is marked by:
- Watch changes announced by blessed bells
- Daily prayer services in the chapel
- Regular maintenance of protective wards
- Careful rationing of blessed water
- Constant vigilance against supernatural threats

Despite the dangers, many crew members develop a fierce pride in their vessels and their ability to safely traverse Hell's treacherous landscapes. The Ontological Bores represent humanity's triumph over supernatural obstacles through the application of industry and ingenuity, even if that triumph requires constant maintenance and eternal vigilance.


# FACTIONS

### The Stoker's Union
Born from a peculiar twist of fate when a crate of smuggled Marxist literature found its way through the Buckingham Rift, these grim-faced laborers discovered a new way to articulate their ancient grievances. The pamphlets spread like wildfire through Hell's working class, with the stokers of the great Furnace of Dis being particularly receptive to concepts of worker solidarity and means of production. Without their backbreaking work, Hell would freeze over, quite literally - a fact that gave them considerable leverage in organizing. They hold immense power but face threats from new technocapital developments, like the River Styx turbine.

In terms of style and accent, the Stoker's Union members are loyal to the Cause but not particularly bright, and speak with a strong cockney accent liberally peppered with misunderstood Marxist terminology.

### The British Trade Delegation
Led by shrewd diplomats and backed by the technological marvels of James Maxwell, the British seek to exploit Hell's resources and cheap labor. The construction of the Buckingham Rift has given them an unprecedented foothold in this alien realm. They navigate the treacherous political landscape with a mix of cunning, bribery, and the occasional threat of angelic intervention.

### The Artisanal Guilds
These ancient orders of hellish craftsmen were responsible for building and stabilizing the infernal side of the trans-dimensional gateway. The influx of British goods and influence threatens their traditional ways, and they resent the disruption to their centuries-old power structures. Expect them to form alliances with disgruntled factions or even engage in occult sabotage to protect their interests.

In terms of style and accent, the Artisanal Guilds are merchants in an economically-desperate struggle for survival.  They see the past as idyllic and the future as a dark and dangerous place.  Yorkshire accent.

### The Iron Choir
Deep within Hell's core lie their massive fortress-factories, industrial cathedrals where raw brimstone is refined into valuable distillate and other infernal combustibles. Their laborers perform shrill metallurgical hymns precisely timed to furnace blasts, their voices becoming one with the machinery. They forge not just physical materials, but intangible commodity-fetishes - raw industrial emotions hammered into demonsteel girders.

The Choir's priest-overseers maintain brutal discipline through a mixture of ancient feudal contracts and cutting-edge British industrial techniques. Their profit margins are inextricably linked to Hell's heat - if the Stoker's Union's grip on the Furnace of Dis weakens, the Iron Choir's forges sputter and supply lines diminish. However, those willing to invest in their experimental "white-flame distillate" refining process might reap enormous rewards... assuming they can handle the risk of catastrophic planar instability.

In terms of style and accent, Iron Choir members speak in clipped, precise tones often punctuated by metallic clicks and whirs from their brass throat-boxes. Their speech patterns follow strict rhythmic patterns, as if every conversation is part of a larger industrial symphony.

### The Cult of the Invasion
This fanatical group is dedicated to preparing for the final invasion of Heaven.  (This is not a feasible or realistic goal.) They see the British as potential allies in their apocalyptic cause, hoping to acquire powerful new weapons and technologies.

In terms of style and accent, the Cult is a group of intellectuals convinced they alone understand the truth of Hell and reality.

### The Underclass
The lowest rung of Hell's social ladder, these wretched souls are the descendants of damned humans who have lived in Hell for generations. They work the most dangerous and degrading jobs, from cleaning the toxic sludge pits to testing experimental British machinery. Many live in sprawling shanty towns built from scavenged industrial waste and broken dreams.

In terms of style and accent, the Underclass speaks with a mix of cockney and various regional British accents, heavily corrupted by infernal slang. Their dialogue should reflect desperation and dark humor about their circumstances.

### Heaven
The Angels are alien and incomprehensible, beautiful and terrifying.  They don't involve themselves much with Hell or Earth, though Spain has managed to open diplomatic channels through which they receive blessed equipment of various kinds.  They speak in [color=white]ALL CAPS[/color] and are unchallengeable in combat.

### La Compagnie Générale des Voies Infernales
A French competitor to the Third Circle Company, the CGVI has recently established its own gateway in Marseilles. While their technology appears less refined than the British Buckingham Rift, they have augmented their engineering with eldritch pacts and forbidden geometries. The company maintains a particular interest in The Abyssal Frontier, establishing research outposts at the very edge of known reality where their scientists commune with entities from beyond space and time. Their trade routes deliberately pass through regions of dimensional instability, allowing their vessels to harvest exotic energies that conventional British Ontological Bores actively avoid.

The company specializes in "cultural exports" - fine wines, controversial literature, and artifacts of questionable origin that pulse with an inner light. Their crews are known for their distinctive obsidian masks which protect them from the psychological effects of their cargo. While British engineers rely on Maxwell's equations, CGVI's success stems from their willingness to embrace more esoteric sciences, coming at cost in both their blood and their humanity.

The company aggressively claims sovereignty over various infernal trade routes, particularly those that skirt the edges of the Abyss. Their enforcers employ both conventional violence and reality-warping abilities gained through their otherworldly partnerships.


### De Koninklijke Wetenschappelijke Helrader Maatschappij
#### ("The Cloggers")

The British refer to this group as the Cloggers in preference to their extremely long and unwieldy formal name (translating roughly to "The Royal Scientific Hell-Wheel Company.")

In collaboration with the Dutch occult organization De Bloedmolen, the Helrader Maatschappij has established a gateway in Rotterdam.  They specialize in the collection of infernal flora and fauna, and the study of infernal geology.  They are particularly interested in the strange creatures that dwell in The Screaming Forests and The Clockwork Wastes.

Unlike the rigid formality of the British Trade Delegation or the esoteric mysticism of the CGVI, the Dutch presence in Hell takes on a more naturalist-academic approach. Their representatives wear practical field gear adapted for infernal conditions - reinforced leather coats treated with protective alchemical compounds, brass-framed goggles with interchangeable lenses for different environmental conditions, and specimen collection gear that would look at home in a natural history museum.

Their facilities tend to be well-organized research stations rather than industrial complexes, featuring extensive specimen preservation chambers, geological sample storage, and detailed taxonomic archives. The architecture combines practical Dutch colonial style with necessary infernal adaptations - high ceilings to vent toxic fumes, reinforced foundations to withstand geological instability, and specialized containment areas for live specimens.

Where British operations focus on industrial exploitation and French expeditions seek metaphysical secrets, Dutch researchers methodically catalog and classify Hell's natural phenomena with scientific precision. Their approach sometimes appears coldly academic to other factions - they're as likely to carefully document a demon's dying moments as they are to help it, all in the name of scientific observation.

The members of De Helrader Maatschappij speak with educated Dutch accents and tend to pepper their speech with Latin taxonomic terms and scientific jargon. They maintain a professional detachment even in the face of cosmic horror, treating encounters with eldritch entities as opportunities for scientific documentation rather than cause for existential dread.

Their bases are notable for their extensive greenhouses where they attempt to cultivate infernal flora under controlled conditions, and their specimen halls filled with preserved creatures floating in jars of alchemically-treated formaldehyde. The walls are typically lined with detailed technical drawings and taxonomic charts attempting to classify Hell's chaotic ecosystem into orderly scientific categories.


# LOCATIONS

### The City of Dis
A sprawling metropolis of twisted, gothic architecture and infernal industry. The city is home to the Furnace of Dis, which powers the factories and workshops that produce the majority of Hell's exports. The streets are filled with the constant clamor of machinery and the cries of the damned souls who toil endlessly in the city's sweatshops and foundries. Dis is also the center of infernal politics, with various demonic factions vying for control over the city's resources and power.

### the Furnace of Dis
The heart of Dis's industrial might, this colossal furnace complex stretches for miles in every direction. Ancient beyond reckoning, its flames have burned since before the first human soul arrived in Hell. The main chamber is a cathedral of industry, where massive iron grates channel the heat generated through burning the River Phlegethon to power the city's factories and forges. The Stoker's Union maintains strict control over access, treating the facility with an almost religious reverence.

While it clearly provides power for Hell's industry, some whisper that it serves a more vital function - perhaps preventing the entire realm from freezing solid, or maintaining some crucial metaphysical balance. The British Trade Delegation has made several attempts to study its inner workings, but the Stokers have thus far successfully resisted all such "modernizing influences."

### The Styx Delta
A vast, swampy region where the River Styx splits into countless tributaries and channels before emptying into the infernal sea. The delta is a labyrinth of mangrove forests, bubbling tar pits, and floating islands of bone and rotting flesh. Strange, bioluminescent creatures swim in the dark waters, and eerie, whispering voices echo through the mist-shrouded air. The delta is home to several competing soul-trading outposts, each one vying for control over the lucrative trade in damned essences.

### The Brimstone Badlands
A desolate, volcanic region where the majority of Hell's brimstone is mined. The landscape is dotted with jagged, obsidian peaks, bubbling lava flows, and vast, open-pit mines where legions of damned souls toil to extract the precious resource. The air is thick with choking, sulfurous fumes, and the ground trembles with the constant rumble of infernal machinery. The Iron Choir maintain heavily fortified compounds in the badlands, protecting their mines and refineries from rival factions and rebellious workers.

### The Screaming Forests
A vast, primeval wilderness of twisted, sentient trees that wail and moan in agony. The forest floor is carpeted in a thick layer of pulsating, fleshy moss, and strange, bioluminescent fungi grow in the shadows. The forest is home to a variety of bizarre and dangerous creatures, including giant, carnivorous slugs and swarms of razor-winged butterflies.

### The Clockwork Wastes
A barren, windswept region where the ruins of ancient, infernal machines litter the landscape. The wastes are home to a variety of scavenger tribes and nomadic bands who pick through the ruins in search of valuable components and arcane technologies. Strange, half-mechanical creatures roam the wastes, the products of long-forgotten experiments in infernal cybernetics. The British have taken a particular interest in the Clockwork Wastes, hoping to uncover lost technologies that could give them an edge in their negotiations with the Iron Choir.

### The Abyssal Frontier
A vast, unexplored region on the edge of Hell, where the infernal realms give way to the infinite darkness of the abyss. The frontier is a place of unsettling silence and strange, alien geometries, where the laws of physics and reason break down. Brave (or foolish) explorers venture into the abyss in search of forbidden knowledge and cosmic secrets, but few return unchanged, if they return at all.
