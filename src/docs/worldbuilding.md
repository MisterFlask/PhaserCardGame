# BACKGROUND
 After James Maxwell mathematically derived the theoretical possibility of extraplanar travel in 1855, Queen Victoria authorized usage of the Empire's finest engineers and artistans for engineering the first trans-dimensional gateway to Hell.  After three decades of failed prototypes, the first stable such gateway (the so-called Buckingham Rift, a castle-sized precisely machined steel ring through which humans and equipment could pass *without* being ripped apart by trans-dimensional pressure gradients) was completed by a collaboration between Henry Bessemer, Joseph Whitworth, and Eliphas Levi in 1885.  Preliminary expeditions and diplomatic envoys had promising results.

 It is now five years later, in 1890. The Third Circle Company, a joint venture between the British Trade Delegation and several prominent Brimstone Barons, has established a state-sponsored monopoly on trans-dimensional shipping between London and Dis. Their fleet of iron-clad amphibious land-crawlers, specially fitted with Maxwell coils and blessed hull plating, makes regular runs through the Buckingham Rift carrying cargo, colonists, and even important political dignitaries.

 (Technically it is not really clear that Hell has any specific relationship to the Christian realm of punishment for sinners, but the aesthetic parallels were strong enough to overcome any academic screeching on this topic, and people simply started referring to it as Hell regardless.  Some academics still futilely insist that everyone call it "The Maxwell-Levi Adiabatic Plane", which they certainly will not.)

# FACTIONS

### The Stoker's Union
Born from a peculiar twist of fate when a crate of smuggled Marxist literature found its way through the Buckingham Rift, these grim-faced laborers discovered a new way to articulate their ancient grievances. The pamphlets spread like wildfire through Hell's working class, with the stokers of the great Furnace of Dis being particularly receptive to concepts of worker solidarity and means of production. Without their backbreaking work, Hell would freeze over, quite literally - a fact that gave them considerable leverage in organizing. They hold immense power but face threats from new technocapital developments, like the River Styx turbine.

In terms of style and accent, the Stoker's Union members are loyal to the Cause but not particularly bright, and speak with a strong cockney accent liberally peppered with misunderstood Marxist terminology.

### The British Trade Delegation
Led by shrewd diplomats and backed by the technological marvels of James Maxwell, the British seek to exploit Hell's resources and cheap labor. The construction of the Buckingham Rift has given them an unprecedented foothold in this alien realm. They navigate the treacherous political landscape with a mix of cunning, bribery, and the occasional threat of angelic intervention.

### The Underclass
The lowest rung of Hell's social ladder, these wretched souls are the descendants of damned humans who have lived in Hell for generations. They work the most dangerous and degrading jobs, from cleaning the toxic sludge pits to testing experimental British machinery. Many live in sprawling shanty towns built from scavenged industrial waste and broken dreams.

In terms of style and accent, the Underclass speaks with a mix of cockney and various regional British accents, heavily corrupted by infernal slang. Their dialogue should reflect desperation and dark humor about their circumstances.

### Heaven
The Angels are alien and incomprehensible, beautiful and terrifying.  They don't involve themselves much with Hell or Earth, though Spain has managed to open diplomatic channels through which they receive blessed equipment of various kinds.  They speak in [color=white]ALL CAPS[/color] and are unchallengeable in combat.

### De Koninklijke Wetenschappelijke Helrader Maatschappij
#### ("The Cloggers")

The British refer to this group as the Cloggers in preference to their extremely long and unwieldy formal name (translating roughly to "The Royal Scientific Hell-Wheel Company.")

In collaboration with the Dutch occult organization De Bloedmolen, the Helrader Maatschappij has established a gateway in Rotterdam.  They specialize in the collection of infernal flora and fauna, and the study of infernal geology.  They are particularly interested in the strange creatures that dwell in The Screaming Forests and The Clockwork Wastes.

Unlike the rigid formality of the British Trade Delegation or the esoteric mysticism of the CGVI, the Dutch presence in Hell takes on a more naturalist-academic approach. Their representatives wear practical field gear adapted for infernal conditions - reinforced leather coats treated with protective alchemical compounds, brass-framed goggles with interchangeable lenses for different environmental conditions, and specimen collection gear that would look at home in a natural history museum.

Their facilities tend to be well-organized research stations rather than industrial complexes, featuring extensive specimen preservation chambers, geological sample storage, and detailed taxonomic archives. The architecture combines practical Dutch colonial style with necessary infernal adaptations - high ceilings to vent toxic fumes, reinforced foundations to withstand geological instability, and specialized containment areas for live specimens.

Where British operations focus on industrial exploitation and French expeditions seek metaphysical secrets, Dutch researchers methodically catalog and classify Hell's natural phenomena with scientific precision. Their approach sometimes appears coldly academic to other factions - they're as likely to carefully document a demon's dying moments as they are to help it, all in the name of scientific observation.

The members of De Helrader Maatschappij speak with educated Dutch accents and tend to pepper their speech with Latin taxonomic terms and scientific jargon. They maintain a professional detachment even in the face of cosmic horror, treating encounters with eldritch entities as opportunities for scientific documentation rather than cause for existential dread.

Their bases are notable for their extensive greenhouses where they attempt to cultivate infernal flora under controlled conditions, and their specimen halls filled with preserved creatures floating in jars of alchemically-treated formaldehyde. The walls are typically lined with detailed technical drawings and taxonomic charts attempting to classify Hell's chaotic ecosystem into orderly scientific categories.


# LOCATIONS

### The City of Dis
A sprawling metropolis of twisted, gothic architecture and infernal industry. The city is home to the Furnace of Dis, which powers the factories and workshops that produce the majority of Hell's exports. The streets are filled with the constant clamor of machinery and the cries of the damned souls who toil endlessly in the city's sweatshops and foundries. Dis is also the center of infernal politics, with various demonic factions vying for control over the city's resources and power.

### the Furnace of Dis
The heart of Dis's industrial might, this colossal furnace complex stretches for miles in every direction. Ancient beyond reckoning, its flames have burned since before the first human soul arrived in Hell. The main chamber is a cathedral of industry, where massive iron grates channel the heat generated through burning the River Phlegethon to power the city's factories and forges. The Stoker's Union maintains strict control over access, treating the facility with an almost religious reverence.

While it clearly provides power for Hell's industry, some whisper that it serves a more vital function - perhaps preventing the entire realm from freezing solid, or maintaining some crucial metaphysical balance. The British Trade Delegation has made several attempts to study its inner workings, but the Stokers have thus far successfully resisted all such "modernizing influences."

### The Styx Delta
A vast, swampy region where the River Styx splits into countless tributaries and channels before emptying into the infernal sea. The delta is a labyrinth of mangrove forests, bubbling tar pits, and floating islands of bone and rotting flesh. Strange, bioluminescent creatures swim in the dark waters, and eerie, whispering voices echo through the mist-shrouded air. The delta is home to several competing soul-trading outposts, each one vying for control over the lucrative trade in damned essences.

### The Brimstone Badlands
A desolate, volcanic region where the majority of Hell's brimstone is mined. The landscape is dotted with jagged, obsidian peaks, bubbling lava flows, and vast, open-pit mines where legions of damned souls toil to extract the precious resource. The air is thick with choking, sulfurous fumes, and the ground trembles with the constant rumble of infernal machinery. The Iron Choir maintain heavily fortified compounds in the badlands, protecting their mines and refineries from rival factions and rebellious workers.

### The Screaming Forests
A vast, primeval wilderness of twisted, sentient trees that wail and moan in agony. The forest floor is carpeted in a thick layer of pulsating, fleshy moss, and strange, bioluminescent fungi grow in the shadows. The forest is home to a variety of bizarre and dangerous creatures, including giant, carnivorous slugs and swarms of razor-winged butterflies.

### The Clockwork Wastes
A barren, windswept region where the ruins of ancient, infernal machines litter the landscape. The wastes are home to a variety of scavenger tribes and nomadic bands who pick through the ruins in search of valuable components and arcane technologies. Strange, half-mechanical creatures roam the wastes, the products of long-forgotten experiments in infernal cybernetics. The British have taken a particular interest in the Clockwork Wastes, hoping to uncover lost technologies that could give them an edge in their negotiations with the Iron Choir.

### The Abyssal Frontier
A vast, unexplored region on the edge of Hell, where the infernal realms give way to the infinite darkness of the abyss. The frontier is a place of unsettling silence and strange, alien geometries, where the laws of physics and reason break down. Brave (or foolish) explorers venture into the abyss in search of forbidden knowledge and cosmic secrets, but few return unchanged, if they return at all.

# STYLE GUIDE
In terms of flavor, please aim for lots of very dry corporate humor combined with lovecraftian horror.
