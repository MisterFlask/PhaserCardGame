✅ rewards (boons, benefits, temptations)
1. standard resource injection

card: choice of 1–3 from pool, random draw, or transform (low agency → high)

relic: standard, rare, or tiered draw (possibly cursed)

gold: flat amount, variable by act

consumable (bureaucratic writ): direct or via trade-up (e.g. trade 2 for 1 upgraded)

2. unique objects

event-specific card or relic (strong thematic resonance)

trinket item that modifies behavior until used/triggered (e.g., “next combat gives +2 energy”)

tagged unique that interacts with other systems (“this relic changes shops until the end of Act 2”)

3. deck shaping

remove card (huge value, high demand)

upgrade card (with or without choice)

transform card (semi-random, slightly riskier)

duplicate card (interesting for combo builds)

4. run meta-currency

permanent unlock progression (roguelite layer)

temporary meta-currency: tokens, favor, keys, whatever

event-gated mechanics (e.g., a password item needed for later node)

5. map manipulation

reveal nodes

path shortcut or warp

convert future node types (e.g. turn a ? into a rest site)

6. Grant consumables of some flavor

(Note that consumables in this game are flavored as bureaucratic paperwork from the infernal lowerarchy)


❌ punishments (costs, risks, consequences)
1. health-based

direct hp loss (flat or %)

max hp loss

poison/burn-style delayed hp loss over time

temporary loss of healing effectiveness

2. deck-based

add curse (with or without choice)

card downgrade (rare but potent)

forced transform or random card loss

card lock (disabled until condition met)

3. economy-based

lose a relic (sometimes player-chosen, sometimes not)

temporarily disable shop access or relic usage

4. combat engagement
