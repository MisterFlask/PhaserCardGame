here's the concise, cleaned-up summary of your roguelike's acts and faction concepts from the lengthy chat dump:

## Acts Overview

* **Act 1: Styx Delta**

  * Environment: Swampy, amphibious biome, now industrially polluted (by British "Styx Dam Project").
  * Enemies: Mutant wildlife, amphibian creatures, The Styxian Boatman's Build

  CENTRAL CONFLICT:  The Styx Boatman's Guild vs the British delegation.

* **Act 2: Deep France**

  * Environment: Frozen trenches where necromancers prop up an undead Napoleonic empire.  Trench warfare mixes with grisly rituals and industrial weaponry.
  * Enemies: Reanimated infantry such as mitrailleuse-organists and old guard grenadiers, plus spectral auditors and trench engineers.  German cryo‑troops and zeppelin grenadiers oppose them.
  * Default undead traits: **Implacable** (revive at ¼ HP a limited number of times), **Decaying** (lose HP each turn ignoring armor), and **Minion** (dies if only minions remain).

CENTRAL CONFLICT:  The necromantic French empire battles the German Reichsinfernokorps; Napoleon Bonaparte commands from exile.

* **Act 3**

  * **Dis Foundry Belt**: industrial hellscape, magma factories.
  * Central conflict is between the Stoker's Union and the capalistic bloodsucking Brimstone Barons
